### Data Architecture – Cereal Market Evolution Project

This document captures all key elements, strategies, and simulated design considerations behind the Cereal Market Evolution dataset created by Nicole Reaves Business Intelligence Analyst, Business Analyst and Certifified Process Improvement Specialist, (CPIS).

---

#### Purpose of Dataset Design
To simulate a real-world consumer packaged goods (CPG) retail environment by designing a structured, AI-enhanced, multi-table dataset that could:
- Reflect actual market conditions
- Support pricing and promotional analysis
- Track brand loyalty and consumer behavior
- Quantify inflationary effects using CPI data
- Enable business intelligence reporting in Power BI and SQL

---

#### Dataset Strategy Overview
I (Nicole) led the end-to-end creation of a synthetic but business-aligned dataset, grounded in:
- **Retailer dynamics** (Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, Amazon Fresh)
- **Brand structure** (national brands vs. private labels)
- **Promotion types** (BOGO, 10% Off, Clearance, No Promotion)
- **Inflation simulation** via integration with **Year-over-Year CPI data** for food-at-home
- **Shrinkflation awareness**, reflected in package size and price-per-ounce comparisons
- **Behavioral economics models** for perceived value, price sensitivity, and loyalty behavior

---

#### Primary Tables in Data Model
1. **Cereal_Sales_Pricing_Dataset_**  
   - Core dataset with: Retailer, Brand, Product, Size, Price, Promotion, Units Sold, Date
2. **Loyalty_Brand_Switching_Data**  
   - Captures prior purchases, switch frequency, and loyalty segmentation
3. **Perceived_vs_Actual_Price_Data**  
   - Compares expected price vs. real price to analyze psychological pricing
4. **Price_Sensitivity_Score_Data**  
   - Assigns scores per product/retailer to quantify elasticity and deal sensitivity
5. **AI_Driven_Price_Projection_Data**  
   - Forecasts future pricing scenarios using historical CPI and pricing trends
6. **CPI_FoodAtHome_Data**  
   - Quarterly YoY inflation data for context and comparative analysis

---

#### Structural Design Elements
- **Entry_ID and Batch_ID** for each record to allow grouping, filtering, and versioning
- **Retailer_Batch_Key** as primary key across related tables
- Companion tables connected via **one-to-many relationships**
- Referential integrity enforced in Power BI’s data model view
- Prepared for **relational modeling** and **DAX-based transformation logic**

---

#### Business Questions Simulated
- How do promotions and price perception affect consumer loyalty and switching?
- Which retailers offer price stability vs. volatility?
- Do private labels gain share during inflation spikes?
- How does shrinkflation impact consumer trust and brand perception?
- What are the most effective strategies for margin protection?

---

#### AI Integration & Enhancement
- Used ChatGPT to simulate behavioral indicators and generate realistic data patterns
- Designed price forecasts based on trend logic and external CPI factors
- Developed AI-enhanced models to project future price trends while accounting for packaging size, inflation, and promotion type
- Integrated perceived vs. actual pricing gaps to evaluate their influence on consumer trust, urgency, and price sensitivity in real-time purchase decisions
- Ensured the dataset allowed for scenario testing, key influencer analysis, and behavioral response modeling to support strategic forecasting in Power BI

### Outlier Treatment & Data Integrity Notes

   While the dataset maintains realistic variability to reflect real-world price behavior, select outlier points—especially in price 
   perception—were intentionally preserved to support behavioral edge case analysis.

**Key examples include:**

- **General Mills Cinnamon Toast Crunch** at Costco (BOGO promotion): Aggregate size of 99oz priced at $2.53, later confirmed to be 
    part of a dual-pack promo (49.5oz x 2), skewing unit perception.
- **Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes** at Costco: Outlier BOGO point at $9.76 for 61.9oz, sharply deviating from surrounding trend.

- These entries were retained for visual and regression contrast analysis, but users are encouraged to apply context-aware filters 
  when running sensitivity models or exploring perception gaps.

- This decision was guided by the project’s emphasis on behavioral pricing analytics and scenario realism.

### Understanding Price Perception Difference (PPD) in Visuals Using Perceived vs Actual Price

**Definition:**  
Price Perception Difference (PPD) measures the average difference between what consumers believe a product *should* cost per ounce (Perceived $/oz) versus what it *actually* costs (Actual $/oz).

---

### Why It Matters

This is not just a simple numerical delta — it’s a **behavioral insight metric**. PPD reflects how aligned or misaligned consumers are in their value interpretation of a product’s price at the unit level.

- A **positive PPD** means the consumer *thought it would cost more* than it did — a potential trust or brand premium signal.
- A **negative PPD** means the consumer *thought it would cost less* — signaling possible sticker shock, dissatisfaction, or elasticity risk.

---

### How It’s Calculated

PPD is an **average of individual perception gaps** across all relevant purchase rows for a selected filter context (e.g., by Brand, Retailer, Promotion, or Timeframe).

Example:

| Consumer | Size (oz) | Perceived $/oz | Actual $/oz | PPD |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| Amy      | 12.8       | 0.52           | 0.44        | 0.08 |
| James    | 11.9       | 0.47           | 0.45        | 0.02 |
| Michelle | 9.0        | 0.40           | 0.43        | -0.03 |
| Stacey   | 22.0       | 0.49           | 0.52        | -0.03 |
| Jose     | 14.5       | 0.41           | 0.45        | 0.04 |

Final **PPD for Group**:  
(0.08 + 0.02 + -0.03 + -0.03 + 0.04) / 5 = **0.016**

---

### Why Analysts Use It

PPD is especially useful when comparing **brand-level** or **promotion-level** pricing trends because it:

- Normalizes pricing behavior across varying package sizes
- Highlights consumer price expectation trends
- Indicates promotional strategy effectiveness
- Supports behavioral pricing analysis in regression or scatter plot visuals

---

### Analyst Tip

If you see a large **negative PPD**, ask:
- Did perceived value drop due to a weak brand?
- Was the promotion not clearly communicated?
- Did price changes outpace consumer expectation?

If you see a high **positive PPD**, ask:
- Is there brand trust or nostalgia bias at play?
- Are consumers mentally anchoring to old inflation levels?
- Is there hidden elasticity to leverage?
