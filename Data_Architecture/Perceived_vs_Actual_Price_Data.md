# Perceived vs Actual Price Data

This dataset explores the gap between **expected (perceived) pricing** and **actual shelf pricing** across retailers and brands. It supports insights into **anchoring bias**, **price trust**, and **consumer value perception** in an inflationary retail environment.

---

## Purpose

To simulate the psychological dynamics of price perception by comparing what consumers expect to pay (based on brand, history, or packaging) with actual market prices — providing a foundation for behavioral pricing insights.
