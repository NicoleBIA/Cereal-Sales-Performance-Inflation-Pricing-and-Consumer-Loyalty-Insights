**Cereal Market Evolution – Power BI Project**  
Nicole Reaves | Business Intelligence & Market Strategy

##  Professional Ethics Statement

> As a data analyst and strategist, I recognize the ethical responsibility that accompanies data-driven storytelling — especially in domains impacting consumer welfare and economic access. This project simulates real-world market intelligence practices while upholding transparency, fairness, and a respect for competitive integrity.

## Summary

This document addresses the ethical responsibilities and governance standards embedded within the Cereal Market Evolution project. It outlines how data is managed, protected, and ethically applied across the project’s analytical lifecycle; from collection and transformation to visualization and strategic insight delivery.

By incorporating data governance protocols and ethical safeguards, this project reinforces best practices for transparency, fairness, and accountability in business intelligence work. These considerations are especially critical when insights influence market strategies, pricing models, and consumer-facing decisions.

Though this project uses synthetic data, it is structured to reflect real-world integrity standards applicable to high-stakes environments such as retail, economics, and strategic planning.

## Purpose

This document outlines the **data governance, security protocols, and ethical considerations** guiding the design and execution of the *Cereal Market Evolution* market intelligence project. While this is a simulated study using synthetic data, the structure reflects real-world principles of responsible data analysis for strategic pricing and consumer insights.

##  Overview

| Category        | Scope Summary |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Data Type**  | AI-generated, fully synthetic dataset (no PII or real transactions) |
| **Tooling**    | Power BI, Excel, GitHub |
| **Focus Areas**| Retailer pricing, consumer behavior, AI price modeling |

## 1. Data Governance

> Clear structure, version control, and auditability across all project layers.

- **Data Provenance:**  
  All datasets were created synthetically to mirror real-world conditions — no live customer, retailer, or sales systems were used.

- **Relational Data Modeling:**  
  A structured **star-schema** model with dimension and fact tables was established in Power BI, with a dedicated `Retailer_Batch_Key` column serving as a primary relationship key.

- **Documentation & Metadata:**  
  A data dictionary, model screenshot, and DAX measure inventory are included in the GitHub `/PowerBI/` folder for transparency and reusability.

- **Version Control & Change History:**  
  GitHub is used to document changes to visualizations, insights, and calculations — enabling collaborative traceability.

## 2. Data Security

> Simulated scope with secure, structured practices reflecting enterprise-ready thinking.

- **No Sensitive Data:**  
  The project contains no personally identifiable information (PII), consumer accounts, or sensitive retailer contracts.

- **File Segmentation:**  
  Visuals, source files, and markdown documentation are stored in clean, well-organized directories to mimic production-grade repository hygiene.

- **Role-based Access (hypothetical Power BI deployment):**  
  In a real-world setting, **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and **workspace permission controls** would be enforced for retailer-specific dashboards.

## 3. Data Ethics

> Transparency, fairness, and responsible use of data storytelling.

- **Synthetic AI Forecast Disclaimer:**  
  AI-projected pricing was generated for simulation and learning purposes. No claims are made regarding real-world pricing behavior or predictive accuracy.

- **Bias & Consumer Impact Transparency:**  
  The project examines phenomena such as **anchoring bias**, **shrinkflation**, and **price-per-ounce distortion** — illuminating real behavioral economics mechanisms that affect consumers.

- **Brand & Retailer Fairness:**  
  All national and store brands were treated equitably, with naming conventions and price logic grounded in retail realism. No favoritism or manipulation of results was applied.

- **Ethical Storytelling:**  
  All visuals are scaled and annotated truthfully — no truncated axes or misleading comparisons are used.
